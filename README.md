# HKUST PHYS3142 Course Project Monte-Carlo-Based-Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation
In this article, weâ€™ve discussed about the Diffusion-Limited Aggregation Model in difference circumstances, including
the modification of the adjacent sticking probability. The dimension of the clustering is studied via the linear regression.
The aggregates formed in DLA have been found to exhibit uniform density with fractal dimension of about 1.7 in two
dimensions would increase with the decrease of the sticking probability. Also, the removing range of the particle would
definitely affect the clustering result, which would highly affect the programming speed. Different shapes of the initial
clustering is also studied. Finally, we discussed about the inconsistant probability to the different directions.
